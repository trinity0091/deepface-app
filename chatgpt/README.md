Sure, here are the steps to create a Docker container of DeepFace:

Install Docker on your system if it is not already installed.

Create a new directory for your Docker container and navigate to it.

Create a new Dockerfile in this directory and add the following code to it:

```
FROM python:3.7-slim-buster

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    libglib2.0-0 \
    libsm6 \
    libxext6 \
    libxrender-dev

# Install DeepFace
RUN pip install deepface

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the code into the container
COPY . /app

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

In the same directory, create a file named app.py and add the following code to it:


```python

from deepface import DeepFace

# Load the pre-trained model
model = DeepFace.build_model('Facenet')

# Perform face recognition
result = DeepFace.verify("img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", model_name='Facenet')

# Print the result
print(result)


```


Note: Make sure you have two images named "img1.jpg" and "img2.jpg" in the same directory as app.py.

Save both files in the same directory.

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and app.py.

Run the following command to build the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t deepface-app .
```

Note: The . at the end specifies that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.

Once the container has been built, run the following command to start the container:

```bash

docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/app deepface-app

```


Note: The -v flag mounts the current directory into the container so that the app.py file and images can be accessed by the container.

The output should display the result of the face verification process between the two images.
That's it! You have successfully created a Docker container of DeepFace and run a face verification process. You can modify the app.py file to perform different tasks using DeepFace.
